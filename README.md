Beautiful Avro Arrow

TODO: 
1. Refractor the code
2. Add more image preprocessing, mainly with color modification.

What I would like to do:
1. I would like to find a way to differ the intensity of the style on the generated image on different part of the image.
			
What I have to fix:
1. Decrease the amount of artifact in the generated image.
